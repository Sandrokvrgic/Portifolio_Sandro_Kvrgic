Included in this repository are three comprehensive reports, each accompanied by their respective codes and datasets. Below, you'll find concise descriptions of the assigned tasks for each report, along with insights into the tools and techniques employed throughout the studies.

**Finding Reported Speech in 17th Century Italian Letters using Machine Learning Methods**

Task:

In a multy disciplinary team we were tasked to find reported speech in 725 Italian letters from 17th century. The team consisted of a historian, language expert and myself, and AI expert. In 5 months of work, we managed to produce some really interesting results, which are shown in the report and can be reproduced by downloading the files from the folder. For more information, I advise to access the READ.ME file specifically made for this project.


**Data Mining**

Task:

Collaborating in pairs, our challenge involved constructing a data mining report to demonstrate the skills acquired during the course. Our assignment was to source or create a unique dataset, subsequently applying two or more machine learning algorithms. The primary objective was to conduct a thorough comparison of these algorithms, showcasing our analytical prowess and understanding of their applications.

Tools & Tehniques:

Programming language - Python

Libraries - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, mpl_toolkits

Tehniques - dataset merging, attribute elimination, scaling, standardization, plotting, correlation analysis, linear regression, support vector machines with radial kernel, and various evaluation methods.

**Four in a row**

Task:

We were presented with a programmed game known as "Four in a Row," and our challenge was to implement a Minimax algorithm on it. The goal was to create an intelligent computer player that would be unbeatable by human opponents. This task demanded the application of advanced artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating the Minimax algorithm, we aimed to elevate the computer player's strategic decision-making, ensuring a formidable and challenging adversary for human players. The end of the task was to compare the performance between normal Minimax algorithm and Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

Tools & Tehniques:

Programming language - Java

Tehniques - Minimax algorithm, Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning
